# CRFasRNN_Ball_Image

Please find the ball data from the [data share link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rtAfoqGY40WxatyjwvOoFg) with password `lesu`.

The temporary model could be tested in `CRFasRNN_ball_data.ipynb`, which will probably be updated recently.

Download the model weights from [here](https://goo.gl/ciEYZi) or [here](https://github.com/sadeepj/crfasrnn_keras/releases/download/v1.0/crfrnn_keras_model.h5) and place it within this directory with the file name `crfrnn_keras_model.h5`.
